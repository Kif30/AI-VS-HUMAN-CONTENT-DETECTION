<h1>AI vs Human Content Detection</h1>

<p>
A <b>multimodal AI system</b> that determines whether content is <b>AI-generated</b> or <b>human-generated</b> across text, images, and videos.
</p>

<p>
Built with a <b>FastAPI backend</b> for inference and a <b>Next.js frontend</b> for interaction — designed to be clean, scalable, and production-aware.

## 🚀 What This Project Does

This system analyzes uploaded content and predicts whether it was created by an AI or a human using specialized deep learning models for each modality.

It is designed with:
- clear separation of concerns  
- real-world deployment constraints  
- clean version control practices
