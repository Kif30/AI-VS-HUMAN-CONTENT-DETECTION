AI vs Human Content Detection

A multimodal AI system that detects whether given text, image, or video content is AI-generated or human-generated.

The project is built as a full-stack application with a FastAPI backend for inference and a Next.js frontend for user interaction.

✨ Features

AI vs Human detection for:

Text

Images

Videos

Separate deep learning model per modality

REST API–based backend

Modern web frontend

Clean separation of code and large model files

🧠 Models Used
Modality	Model
Text	DeBERTa-v3
Image	XceptionNet
Video	XceptionNet + TCN

⚠️ Trained model weights are not included in this repository.

▶️ How to Run the Project
1️⃣ Backend Setup

Create and activate a virtual environment:

cd backend
python -m venv venv

Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
Linux / macOS
source venv/bin/activate


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the backend:

uvicorn main:app --reload


Backend runs at:

http://127.0.0.1:8000


API documentation:

http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

2️⃣ Frontend Setup

Recommended Node version: Node 18 LTS

cd code   
pnpm install
pnpm run dev


Frontend runs at:

http://localhost:3000

📦 Model Files (Important)

Due to GitHub file size limits, trained model weights are not included in this repository.

📧 Requesting Models

To obtain the trained models for testing or evaluation, please contact via email:

Email: your-email@example.com

You will receive:

Model download links

create a file backend/main models 

Models must be placed inside:

backend/main models/

⚠️ Notes & Limitations

Detection results are probabilistic, not absolute

Accuracy depends on training data and content type

Video detection is computationally expensive

Newer generative models may reduce detection reliability

🧠 Final Note

This repository intentionally contains only source code.
Large files and trained models are kept separate to maintain a clean, lightweight, and reproducible codebase.
